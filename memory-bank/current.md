# Current - Active Work Context

## Project Status
**Completed**: Functional MCP server template with comprehensive multi-layer security architecture, live-tested and documented.
**Open**: TBD additional considerations.

## Current Architecture
- **SDK-First**: Official MCP SDK handles all protocol implementation
- **BaseTool[T] Pattern**: Type-safe tool development with auto-injection logging
- **Production Logging**: Environment-driven configuration with correlation IDs, structured output
- **Multi-Layer Security**: Comprehensive security architecture with automatic protections, tool-level configuration, and explicit developer choices
- **Test Coverage**: 47 passing tests (28 original + 19 security tests) covering business logic and security features

## Active Components
- **Server**: `src/mcp_template/server.py` - SDK-based with comprehensive logging and Layer 1 security enforcement
- **Tool Pattern**: `src/mcp_template/tools/base.py` - Generic BaseTool[T] with auto-injected loggers and Layer 2 security integration
- **Security Middleware**: `src/mcp_template/utils/security_middleware.py` - Layer 1 automatic security protections
- **Security Utilities**: `src/mcp_template/utils/security.py` - Enhanced with tool validation and Layer 2/3 support
- **Example Tools**: CalculatorTool and AsyncEchoTool demonstrating patterns
- **Security Examples**: `examples/secure_file_tool_example.py` - Comprehensive security demonstration
- **Production Example**: `examples/calculator_server.py` - Live-tested server with security integration
- **Utilities**: Logging, security, and error handling modules

## Key Architectural Decisions
- **SDK-First**: Zero protocol maintenance burden, focus on tool patterns only
- **Auto-Injection Logging**: Tools get standardized loggers without boilerplate
- **Type Safety**: Full Pydantic validation with JSON schema generation
- **Simplification**: 80% codebase reduction from original custom implementation

## Success Metrics
- **Time to fork server and register tool(s)**: <10 minutes
- **Code Simplicity**: <250 lines of code for core server.
- **Maintainability**: Fully descriptive code comments and docstrings.
- **Logging**: 
- **Testing**: Unit testing for all classes and functions. Critical path integration testing. All unit tests must pass. 

## Future Development
See roadmap.md

## Current Work Focus
**SSE-Ready Architecture Complete** - Server prepared for future SSE transport without breaking existing STDIO integrations

### Completed Implementation: "SSE-Ready Without Breaking Changes"

**Transport Abstraction**: ✅ COMPLETE
- Extracted STDIO server logic into dedicated `run_stdio_server()` function
- Added `--transport` CLI argument (currently accepts only "stdio")
- Reserved CLI interface for future SSE implementation
- Added comprehensive comments indicating future SSE enhancement points
- Maintained 100% backward compatibility for existing STDIO users

**Architecture Changes**: ✅ COMPLETE
- **server.py**: Refactored to support transport abstraction without changing default behavior
- **CLI Interface**: Added `--transport {stdio}` argument with future SSE planning comments
- **Function Separation**: Clean separation between server setup and transport execution
- **Future-Ready Comments**: Clear indicators for where SSE transport will be added

**Validation Results**: ✅ ALL TESTS PASS
- ✅ All 47 existing tests continue to pass (no regressions)
- ✅ Default behavior unchanged: `python3 server.py` works identically
- ✅ Explicit transport selection works: `python3 server.py --transport stdio`
- ✅ Server startup and shutdown work correctly
- ✅ All logging and security features remain intact

**Future SSE Implementation Path**: ✅ DOCUMENTED
- Transport selection logic placeholder added with comments
- CLI argument structure established for easy extension
- Function architecture ready for `run_sse_server()` addition
- Zero breaking changes required for future SSE implementation

### Previous Work: Security Enhancement Complete
**Security Enhancement Complete** - Multi-layer security architecture successfully implemented

### Completed Implementation: "Security by Default, Flexibility by Choice"

**Layer 1 (Automatic - Cannot be bypassed)**: ✅ COMPLETE
- Global rate limiting (100 requests/minute default, configurable via MCP_RATE_LIMIT)
- Input size limits (1MB default, configurable via MCP_MAX_INPUT_SIZE)
- Output size limits (10MB default, configurable via MCP_MAX_OUTPUT_SIZE)
- Execution timeouts (30s default, 5min max, configurable via MCP_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT/MCP_MAX_TIMEOUT)
- Output rate limiting (50MB/minute, configurable via MCP_OUTPUT_RATE_LIMIT)
- Basic type safety validation (blocks dangerous objects like functions)
- String length validation (100KB per string, configurable via MCP_MAX_STRING_LENGTH)

**Layer 2 (Guided Defaults - Tool configuration)**: ✅ COMPLETE
- Auto-sanitize strings (default: ON, can be disabled per tool)
- Path validation (opt-in for file operations with allowed_paths whitelist)
- Tool-specific timeout configuration with validation
- Security configuration validation at tool initialization
- Automatic security warnings for potential file path parameters

**Layer 3 (Explicit Choices - Developer decisions)**: ✅ COMPLETE
- Path whitelisting enforcement for file operations
- Custom timeout limits with explicit acknowledgment for >60s
- Security feature overrides with clear documentation requirements

### Implementation Architecture: ✅ COMPLETE
- **security_middleware.py**: Core Layer 1 enforcement (SecurityMiddleware, SecurityConfig)
- **server.py**: Integrated Layer 1 protections into tool call handler
- **security.py**: Enhanced with tool validation and Layer 2/3 support
- **base.py**: Enhanced BaseTool with Layer 2 security integration

### Success Criteria: ✅ ALL MET
- ✅ All Layer 1 protections automatically applied (cannot be bypassed)
- ✅ Clear security configuration patterns for tool developers
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and logging for security events
- ✅ Backward compatibility with existing tools (all 28 original tests pass)
- ✅ Complete test coverage for security features (19 new security tests, 47 total tests passing)

### Security Features Delivered
- **Comprehensive Input Validation**: Size limits, type safety, string sanitization
- **Resource Protection**: Rate limiting, execution timeouts, output size controls
- **Path Security**: Directory traversal prevention, path whitelisting
- **Error Security**: Sanitized error messages, detailed security logging
- **Configuration Flexibility**: Environment-based configuration for all limits
- **Developer Guidance**: Automatic warnings and validation for security misconfigurations

### Additional Work Completed
- **Updated Examples**: Enhanced `examples/calculator_server.py` with full security integration
- **Documentation Updates**: Updated README.md to reflect current architecture and security features
- **Live Testing**: Successfully tested MCP server via live MCP connection with calculator operations
- **Security Demonstration**: Created comprehensive security example showing all three layers in action

### Live Validation Results
- **MCP Integration**: Server successfully connects and responds via MCP protocol
- **Calculator Operations**: Addition (15 + 27 = 42) and multiplication (8 × 9 = 72) working perfectly
- **Async Tools**: AsyncEcho tool working with security protections
- **Security Transparency**: All protections work invisibly to end users. Not tested using realistic error or attack modeling.
- **Performance**: No noticeable impact on response times
