# Roadmap - Future Direction

## Current Status
**Core Development Complete**: All essential template functionality is implemented and production-ready.

## Strategic Direction

### Template Philosophy
- **SDK-First**: Leverage official MCP SDK for protocol handling
- **Tool-Focused**: Add value only in tool development patterns
- **Production-Ready**: Comprehensive logging, security scaffolding, type safety
- **Fork-Optimized**: <5 minutes from fork to deployment

### Architecture Notes
- **Zero Protocol Maintenance**: SDK handles all MCP complexity
- **Type-Safe Tool Development**: BaseTool[T] pattern with auto-validation
- **Auto-Injection Logging**: Zero-boilerplate standardized logging

## Future Development Priorities

### Community-Driven Enhancement
- **Additional Example Tools**: Based on real-world use cases and community requests
- **Integration Guides**: Patterns for common external service integrations
- **Deployment Templates**: Docker, cloud platforms, enterprise environments

### Enterprise Considerations
- **Advanced Security Patterns**: Enhanced validation and sanitization based on production needs
- **Monitoring Integration**: Built-in observability for production deployments
- **Performance Optimization**: Caching, connection pooling, resource management
- **Tool Composition**: Patterns for complex multi-tool servers

### Utility Modules Enhancement (Optional Future Consideration)
**Status**: Under consideration - not currently planned for implementation

**Concept**: Provide standardized utility functions for common tool development patterns while maintaining the template's core simplicity philosophy.

**Potential Implementation**:
- **HTTP Client Utilities** (`utils/http_client.py`): Standardized async HTTP requests with security, timeouts, retries, and error handling
- **File Operations** (`utils/file_operations.py`): Secure file handling with path validation, size limits, and encoding detection
- **Validation Helpers** (`utils/validation.py`): Common validation patterns for URLs, emails, file paths, etc.
- **Response Formatting** (`utils/formatting.py`): Consistent response formatting and data transformation helpers

**Benefits**:
- Standardization of common patterns without framework complexity
- Security best practices built into utility functions
- Maintains BaseTool[T] simplicity (no inheritance changes)
- Easy to adopt incrementally (import and use as needed)

**Design Principles**:
- **No Templates**: Avoid tool inheritance hierarchies or framework abstractions
- **Function-Based**: Simple utility functions, not classes or complex APIs
- **Optional**: Tools can use utilities or implement patterns directly
- **Maintainable**: Small, focused functions with single responsibilities

**Decision Criteria**:
- Community demand for standardized patterns
- Evidence of repeated implementation patterns across forks
- Ability to maintain template simplicity while adding value
- Clear benefit over current example-based approach

**Alternative Approaches Considered**:
- Tool template classes (rejected - adds complexity)
- Enhanced examples with patterns (current approach)
- Documentation-driven standardization (lightweight alternative)

### Ecosystem Development
- **Developer Tools**: CLI utilities
- **Documentation Portal**: Interactive guides and tutorials
- **Community Registry**: Showcase of community-built tools and patterns

## Success Metrics
- **Development Speed**: <5 minutes to fork (not including new tool-specific logic)
- **Code Simplicity**: <250 lines of code for core server.
- **Maintainability**: 
- **Logging**: 
- **Testing**: Unit testing for all classes and functions. Critical path integration testing. All unit tests must pass. 


## Future Development Triggers
Future development is mostly TBD, and may be drive by factors such as:
- **Real-world usage patterns** and community feedback
- **Specific enterprise requirements** for security and monitoring
- **Integration needs** with popular external services
- **Performance requirements** for high-throughput scenarios
